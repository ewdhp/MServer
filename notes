if you are using auto reload (e.g., dotnet watch run) with a volume mount for your code, you do not need to rebuild the Docker image for code changes.
The container will pick up code changes automatically from your host.

You only need to rebuild and push the image if:

You change the Dockerfile.
You want to update the image on Docker Hub.
You want to deploy your changes to another environment.
Summary:

For local development with hot reload and volume mounts: No image rebuild needed for code changes.
For Dockerfile or dependency changes, or to update Docker Hub: Rebuild and push the image.
